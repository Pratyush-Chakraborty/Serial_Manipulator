# Serial_Manipulator
#This repository consists code of forward kinematics, inverse kinematics and trajectory generation
#FORWARD KINEMATICS:
     1) Forward kinematics is basically a mathematical method that is used to find the position of the end effector of the serial manipulator if we give the angles
     between the links of the serial manipulator
     2) In this code we have used the concept of homogenous matrix, rotation matrix and Denavitâ€“Hartenberg parameters to calculate the general equation of the 
     coordinates of the end effector in terms of theta1, theta2, and theta3 as my serial manipulator consists of 3 links + 1 base link that has 3 degrees of freedom
     3) By using the above methods we get 3 equation of x, y and z in terms of theta1, theta2, and theta3.
#INVERSE KINEMATICS:
     1) Inverse kinematics is basically a mathematical method that calculates the inverse of the forward kinematics in simple words it calculates the angles between
     links for a specific position of the end effector.
     2) In this code we have used the Newton Raphson method of approximation of roots to find the angles as we have three multi variable functions.
     3) Newton Raphson Method is basically based on the concept of slope to find the roots of the equation
     4) By using the above methods we get 3 angles theta1, theta2, and theta3 for some specific x, y and z coordinate that lies within the range of our robotic arm.
#TRAJECTORY GENERATION:
     1) Trajectory is generated by iterating the inverse kinematics to find the various angles for some minute change in coordinates
     2) For example if we need to draw a straight line we divide the straight line into many small parts and then calculate inverse kinematics for each part to 
     generate the trajectory
